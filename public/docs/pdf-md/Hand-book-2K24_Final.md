## 5. FLORICULTURE

The potential of floriculture has significantly energized the agricultural  sector,  especially  in  Thiruvananthapuram.  With  the  growing demand  for  flowers  during  festive  seasons  like  Onam,  local  production  has become a priority. Various institutions and government bodies, including the Agricultural  Department,  local  bodies,  the  Employment  Guarantee  Scheme, Kudumbashree, and agricultural cooperatives, are collaborating to encourage collective efforts in flower cultivation. These initiatives aim to promote selfsufficiency in flower production, reduce dependency on external sources, and provide sustainable livelihoods for local farmers and communities. This year, a variety of flowers are being cultivated locally such as Bandi , Marigold ,  and Vatamulla etc.

## 9. ANIMAL HUSBANDARY

Animal husbandry plays an important role in strengthening the economy of  the  state.    It  provides  self-employment  opportunity  to  the  unemployed  in rural areas. The  progress in livestock will lead to  a  more  balanced development  in  rural  economy  and  hence  up-lift  the  weaker  section  of  the society.

## 14.6 Road Accidents

In recent years, there has been a general trend of increasing road accidents,  primarily  due  to  the  growth  in  vehicle  ownership  and  traffic congestion. Over-speeding, drunk driving, and lack of awareness about road

safety rules are common contributing factors. Inadequate road infrastructure, including  poorly  maintained  roads  and  lack  of  pedestrian  facilities,  can contribute  to  accidents.  The  Kerala  government  has  implemented  various measures  to  improve  road  safety,  including  stricter  enforcement  of  traffic laws, construction of better roads, and public awareness campaigns. The use of technology, such as speed cameras and traffic monitoring systems, has helped improve road safety.

## EDUCATION

## 15. EDUCATION

There  has  been  amazing  developments  in  the  field  of  education  in Kerala during the last few years by different governments. The Kerala Model is  so  famous  all  over  the  country,  now  because  of  the  systematic  and progressive developments in Kerala. Women in Kerala are generally far better off than women in the rest of India, and people at all levels of society have greater access to education - as well as a greater say in their governance - than can  be  found  in  any  other  Indian  state.  Public  provisioning  of  education facilities has long been the basis of Kerala's acclaimed development achievements.  As  per  2011  census,  Kerala  ranks  first  in  the  State  with  a literacy rate of 94%.  The literacy rate increased from 74.04% in 2001 to 94% in  2011.    Kerala  has  become  the  first  Indian  state  to  achieve  100%  primary education.

## 18. IRRIGATION

Kerala is a state in India that receives abundant rainfall throughout the year  due  to  its  location  in  the  Western  Ghats.  As  a  result,  the  need  for irrigation is relatively low in most parts of the state. However, in some areas where the terrain is hilly or where the rainfall is erratic, irrigation systems are necessary to support agriculture. In recent years, modern irrigation techniques have  also  been  adopted  in  certain  areas  of  the  state,  particularly  in  the cultivation of cash crops like rubber and spices. Drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation are among the methods that are commonly used in these areas.

## 19.  HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE

Kerala's  health  status  is  almost  on  a  par  with  that  of  developed economies.  The state has succeeded in increasing life expectancy as well as reducing infant and maternal mortality.  Our healthcare system has helped in providing  treatment  facilities  to  people  of  all  strata  of  society.    The  high literacy  rate,  especially  among  the  females,  also  played  a  major  role  in improving the health scenario.

## 25 . INTEGRATED CHILD DEVELOPMENT SERVICES

Integrated  Child  Development  Services  (ICDS)  is  a  major  national programme that addresses the needs of Children under the age of six years.  It seeks  to  provide  children  with  an  integrated  package  of  services  including supplementary nutrition, healthcare and pre-school education.  Since the health and nutrition needs of the child cannot be addressed in isolation from those of the mother, the programme also extends to adolescent girls, pregnant women and  lactating  mothers.  Early  childhood  is  important  in  the  overall  human capacity development and ICDS  aims at ensuring child survival and development during this crucial period offering a wide range of services.
