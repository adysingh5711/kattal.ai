Thiruvananthapuram  district  focus  on  improving  productivity  and sustainability on small landholdings through scientific and digital methods. Farmers  increasingly  use  protected  cultivation  such  as  polyhouses  and shade-net  houses  for  vegetables  and  flowers,  along  with  micro-irrigation systems like drip and sprinkler irrigation to conserve water. Organic farming techniques, bio-fertilisers, and eco-friendly pest control methods are encouraged, especially through Kudumbashree and farmer collectives.

## 5 FLORICULTURE

The potential of floriculture has significantly energized the agricultural  sector,  especially  in  Thiruvananthapuram.  With  the  growing demand for flowers during festive seasons like Onam, local production has become a priority. Various institutions and government bodies, including the Agricultural Department, local bodies, the Employment Guarantee Scheme, Kudumbashree, and agricultural cooperatives, are collaborating to encourage collective efforts in flower cultivation. These initiatives aim to promote selfsufficiency  in  flower  production,  reduce  dependency  on  external  sources, and provide sustainable livelihoods for local farmers and communities. This year,  a  variety  of  flowers  are  being  cultivated  locally  such  as Bandi , Marigold , and Vadamulla etc.

## 14.9  Road Accidents

In recent years, there has been a general trend of increasing road accidents, primarily due to the growth in vehicle ownership and traffic congestion. Over-speeding, drunk driving, and lack of  awareness  about  road  safety  rules  are  common  contributing  factors. Inadequate road infrastructure, including poorly maintained roads and lack of pedestrian facilities, can contribute to accidents. The Kerala government has  implemented  various  measures  to  improve  road  safety,  including stricter enforcement of traffic laws, construction of better roads, and public

awareness campaigns. The use of technology, such as speed cameras and traffic monitoring systems, has helped improve road safety.

## 18. IRRIGATION

Irrigation  is  crucial  for  agricultural  development  as  it  ensures  a reliable  water  supply,  increases  crop  productivity,  reduces  dependence  on monsoon  rainfall,  and  supports  food  security  and  rural  livelihoods.  In Thiruvananthapuram district, irrigation plays an important role in sustaining agriculture, particularly paddy cultivation, coconut groves, and horticultural crops.  The  district's  irrigation  system  includes  major  projects  like  the Neyyar  and  Peppara  dams,  along  with  minor  irrigation  schemes,  canals, ponds, and wells, which help regulate water availability during dry seasons.

Per  capita  income  serves  as  an  important  indicator  of  the average income level of the population and reflects the overall economic wellbeing  of  a  region.

## 23. PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM

The  Public  Distribution  System  (PDS)  is  a  government-supported food security program in India aimed at ensuring the availability of essential commodities  at affordable prices to vulnerable sections of society. Under this system,  items  such  as  rice, wheat,  sugar,  and  kerosene are procured by the government  and  distributed through  a  network  of  Fair Price  Shops  (ration  shops) . It is well known that Kerala had one of the best run and most effective PDS networks in India.

## 32 EXTREME POVERTY

The Extreme  Poverty  Eradication  Project  (EPEP),  also known  as  the Athidaridrya  Nirmarjana  Project ,  is  a  flagship initiative of the Government of Kerala aimed at identifying and uplifting families living in extreme deprivation. Unlike traditional  poverty  alleviation  programs,  EPEP  focuses  on  the most  vulnerable  individuals  who  are  often  outside  existing support  systems,  addressing  their  needs  across  four  critical dimensions: food security, healthcare, housing, and stable income.  In  the Thiruvananthapuram  District,  the  project  has demonstrated significant  success,  identifying  7,278  individuals in  extreme  poverty  and  successfully  integrating  6,204  into localized micro-plans to ensure their sustainable recovery.

As part of a comprehensive social welfare strategy, the EPEP  empowers  local  governments  to  provide  tailor-made solutions such as cooked meals, specialized medicine, and safe housing,  ultimately  striving  to  make  Kerala  the  first  state  in India to be entirely free of extreme poverty.
