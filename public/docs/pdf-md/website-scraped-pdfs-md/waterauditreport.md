## 1.  Background

'Vattatha  Uravakkay  Jalasamrudhi'  is  a  project  aimed  at  replenishing  and  rejuvenating water  resources  in  Kattakada  Legislative  Assembly  Constituency,  in  Thiruvananthapuram District.  The  project  was  launched  on  22  March  2017,  the  World  Water  Day.  As  part  of  the project,  detailed  Management  Action  Plan  was  prepared  with  the  help of  various  Government Departments and other agencies and many activities, trainings; workshops were carried out in the  LAC.  As  a  step  forward,  they  wish  to  conduct  water  auditing  of  public  buildings  in  the Kattakada constituency to convey the message to the public at large on water conservation and its judicious use. In addition, as a pilot project they wish to do it for eight public buildings in the LAC (Six Grama Panchayath Offices, One Block Panchayath Office and One Community Health Centre)

Adv. I B Sathish, MLA from Kattakada LAC sent a letter to CWRDM Executive Director to look into this matter. A proposal was prepared by CWRDM and was sent to Adv. I B Sathish, MLA, based on the above request and subsequent discussions the concerned Scientist had with various personnel involved in the project. Adv. I B Sathish, MLA sent the proposal to Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment (KSCSTE) to take up the study. The Member Secretary, KSCSTE instructed the Executive Director, Centre for Water Resources Development and Management (KSCSTE-CWRDM) to conduct the study. As per directions from the Executive Director  CWRDM,  Scientist  &amp;  officer  in  charge  of  Neyyattinkara  Subcente  of  CWRDM  visited these public buildings and conducted the study and this report was prepared.

## 2. Introduction

The development of water resources to man's benefit has been a fundamental factor in the evolution of civilizations throughout the history. Human populations continue to grow and shift as per the availability  of  quality  water  resources.  It  is  essential  that  man  utilize  existing  water resources  in  the  most  careful,  efficient  manner.  Water  audits  provide  a  rational,  scientific framework that categorizes all water use in your system. It is a tool to overcome water shortage, leakage, wastage and losses.

With the help of water audit, we can identify and quantify the water uses, formulate steps, which can be taken to reduce water use and losses. Water audit and its analysis that can solve not  only  many  water  related  problems  but  also  saves  precious  resources  and  public  money. Some water losses are unavoidable, and it is not worth the expense to try to eliminate every drop escaping your system. However, most of the loss that occurs in water systems can be managed by conducting a water audit. The results can help you prioritize steps to implement cost-effective water-saving measures.

Places that serve everyone in the community-parks, libraries, public buildings, markets, hospitals,  plazas,  playgrounds, sidewalks and other hang outs-are more important. Hospitals and  office  buildings  require  a  large  water  volume  for  mechanical  systems,  once  the  systems have been determined, a water savings plan can be developed. In this context eight (8) Public buildings, six (6) Grama panchayath offices, one Block panchayath office and one Community

health  center,  located  in  Kattakada  LAC  were  selected  to  conduct  the  water  audit,  which  is presented in the following sections of this report.

## 3.  Kattakada LAC

Kattakada is situated at the centre of four places: Trivandrum to the west, Neyyattinkara to the south, Neyyar Dam to the east and Nedumangad to the north. Trivandrum district has a climate that borders between tropical savanna climate and tropical monsoon climate. In a broad sense, it can be said that the district experience a tropical monsoon climate. The annual variation of mean air temperature at Trivandrum district is from 21o C to 34o C. The humidity is high and rises  about  90%  during  the  monsoon  season.  The  average  annual  rainfall  of  the  district  is 2035mm.  It  is  significant  that  Kattakkada  area  gets  benefits  of  both  monsoon  -  southwest monsoon and northeast monsoon.

Figure1: Kattakada LAC location map

As per Economic  Review 2018, State Planning Board, Kerala, the net annual groundwater availability of the Trivandrum district is 296.24 MCM  whereas  the gross groundwater  draft  for  all  users  of  the  district  is  178.54  MCM,  considering  the  domestic

requirement until 2025 the net ground water availability for future is 114.45 MCM. The stage of ground water development is 60.27%. As per Ground Water information booklet of Trivandrum district  (Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  Central  Ground  Water  Board,  Govt.  of  India)  out  of  12 blocks (prior to reorganisation of blocks), five are 'Semi critical' and nine are 'Safe'. Athiyanuur, Nedumangad, Nemom, Parassala  and  Trivandrum  blocks  in  Trivandrum  district  falls  in  semicritical category.  Kattakkada  LAC  belongs  to 'semi-critical category' as it is located in Nedumangad  and  Nemom  blocks.  The  groundwater  in  Kattakkada  area  is  generally  potable except in few locations. The water is generally alkaline in nature and all the major constituents are within the permissible limit. The groundwater is suitable for domestic and drinking purposes.

## 4. Objectives

The major objectives of the study are:

-  To Conduct water audit of 8 public buildings in Kattakada LAC;
-  To understand the water usage pattern and consumption levels at each offices;
-  To reduce water wastage and its unnecessary use;
-  To identify opportunities to make water use more efficient;
-  To identify ways to conserve water; and
-  To create awareness among users.

## 5. Public Buildings Selected for Study

Eight  (8)  public  offices  were  selected  to  be  included  in  this  study.  Out  of  these  eight  (8) offices,  six  (6)  were  Grama  panchayath  offices,  of  the  remaining  two  (2)  one  was  block panchayath  office  and  the  other  one  was  a  community  health  center.  These  buildings  were spread across the LAC as shown in the Figure: 1 above. All these eight offices were visited to understand  their  water  sources  and  its  usage  pattern.  The  basic  details  of  these  buildings collected during the visit are given below.

## 6.  Methodology

The  methodology  of  water  audit  is  the  framework  for  categorizing  and  quantifying  all water  uses.  American  Water  Works  Association  (AWWA)  and  International  Water  Association (IWA) developed a graphical way to think about the standard water balance in 2000, which is presented in Figure 2.

Figure 2: AWWA/IWA Water Balance

It  is  important  to  understand  that  the  vertical  height  of  each  category  represents  a proportional amount of water. Thus, the height of the System Input category represents all water pumped by the system in a given time period. This amount of water can be broken down into two

additional categories, Authorized Use and Water Losses. This vertical height water measurement holds true  across  the  entire  standard  water  balance.  Following  identify  important  relationships just by glancing at the standard water balance.

- 
- 
- 
- System Input = Authorized Use + Water Losses;
- Water Losses = Apparent Losses + Real Losses;
- Non-revenue Water
-  Apparent Losses
- = Water Losses + Unbilled Authorized Use.
- = Metering Inaccuracies + Unauthorized Use.
-  Real Losses =  Leakage  on  Mains  +  Overflows  on  Storages  +  Leakage  on
- Service Connections

To calculate the above-mentioned equations the below given five steps are to be followed:

- Source Evaluation.
- Calculation of Authorized Consumption.
- Evaluation of Apparent Losses.
- Evaluation of Real Losses.
- Performance Measurement.

The following steps were carried out to understand the water system of the selected eight public offices

- Preliminary  site  visit  to  the  offices  to  understand  the  nature  of  water  uses  and  the systems installed in the buildings
- Discussions with the administrative department on current situation and the past trends in water  consumption,  current  sources,  supply  amount,  source  metering,  distribution, storage, wastewater generation etc.
- Sample survey for finding quantity of water consumption.
- Records  of  water  pumped  to  overhead  tanks  and  water  withdrawn  from  public  water supply (recorded through meters) were collected.

The following issues were noted during the process:

-  Lack of proper inflow measurement system
-  Installed meters at the inlet points of public water supply are not operational
-  Categorywise/sectionwise metering systems are not in place
-  Non-availability of manpower to monitor daily water inflow/pumping
-  Pumping from wells even before the overhead tanks go empty
-  Combined use of Public water supply and water from well at the same time

Due  to  the  above  mentioned  constraints  it  was  decided  to  follow  the  first  equation  of  water balance in this study, i.e.,  System Input = Authorized Use + Water Losses,

Therefore,

Water Losses = System Input - Authorized Use

## 7. Water Audit and Assessment

## System Input &amp; Authorized Use Assessment

The following activities were carried out to understand the system use and authorized use of the eight public buildings

- Visits to the buildings to understand the nature of water uses and the systems installed in the buildings;
- Discussions with the administrative department on current situation and the past trends in water consumption, current sources, supply amount, source metering, distribution, storage, wastewater  generation etc.; and
- Sample survey for finding quantity of water consumption
- Records of water pumped to overhead tanks and water withdrawn from public water supply (recorded from water meter) were collected to estimate actual supply

As per the available details from each office, the system input and authorized use were calculated as given below for each office.

## 7.1 Pallichal Grama Panchayath Office

An Open-Well existing inside the office area is the only source of water for this threestorey building. The water from the well is pumped using a motor pump to an overhead storage tank having a capacity of 1000 Litres, placed on top of the third floor of the building.

## System Input

Quantity of water pumped to overhead tank is obtained from survey conducted in the month of December 2018.

Average pumping time during the observed month was 20 Mins/day = 20.5 X 40 System Input = 820 Litres/day

## Authorized Use

In total, there are three toilets in the building with one each for all the floors. Four taps and two wash-basins were also identified to be used in the observed month. Ground floor has two water taps  while  first  and  second  floor  both  provided  with  one  water  tap  and  one  washbasin  each. Water from the nearby well is pumped to an overhead storage tank of capacity 1000 Litres every morning except holidays.

This  quantity  helps  to  arrive  at  total  consumption  of  water  for  each  day.  Number  of  plumbing points and average number of users (permanent staffs and visitors) will give per capita per day water usage. This data is helpful for finding the water requirement and wastage of water. The practice  of  water  usage  among  staffs  will  decide  the  extend  of  water  wastage.  The  total  staff strength at panchayat is 20. It is estimated that usually on a regular working day of the week around 35 people are usually present in the premises which includes staffs, peoples representatives, visitors, etc.

Average daily pumping time 20.4 minute

Daily drinking water consumption = 1.6 x 35 = 56 L

( Per capita per day drinking water is 1.6 lpcd)

Flush water use in toilets by staff =2.5 x 6 x 20 x 90/100 = 270 L

( The average daily flush in toilets by staff  is 2.5 &amp; capacity of the urinal cistern is 5 L

90 percent of staff present daily)

Flush water use in toilets by visitors  = 0.5 x 6 x 15 = 45.0 L

( The average daily flush in toilets by visitors  is taken as 0.5 )

Total flush water use in toilets = 315.0 L

Total time tap is opened on average day for face &amp; hand washing by staff is 2 x 1.0 x 20 x 90/100

## =  36 minutes

( average daily frequency of hand washing per staff is 2 and average time the tap is opened while hand washing is 1.5  minutes )(assuming 50 percent of staff using tap daily)

Water use in basins for face/hand washing by staff = 36 x 4 = 144 L

( the average flow rate in the basins is around 5 litres per minute )

Total time tap is opened on average day for hand washing by visitors is 15 x 1 x 20/60 = 5 minutes

) (assuming

( average daily frequency of hand washing per visitor is 1 and average time the tap is opened while hand washing is 20 seconds )

Water use in basins for face/hand washing by visitors = 5 x 4 = 20 L

Total water use in basins for face/hand washing = 164 L

Total time tap is opened an average day for washing lunchbox/utensils by staff is 1 X 2.0 x 20 x 90/100 x 50/100 = 18 mins

= 18 x 4 = 72 Litres

Total water use in floor mopping is approx 50 L/day

Therefore based on the above recordings, monitoring and calculation the total water consumption is 528.5 L per day.

## Water Losses

Water Losses  = System Input -Authorized Use

- = 820 -657

- = 163 Litres

- = 19.8 % of System Input

- = 24.8 % of Authorised Use

## 7.2       Vilavoorkal Grama Panchayath Office

They are using water from public water supply. As the water meter is concealed, water usage data is not available from the panchayat. In total there are 4 toilets in the building, which includes 2 in the Basement floor and one each for ground  and first  floors. Basement floor is provided with 4 water taps and 3 washbasins, Ground floor with one water tap and 3 washbasins and First floor has one water tap and one washbasin.

## System Input

System input could not be calculated since the public water supply meter is concealed.

## Authorized Use

The total staff strength at panchayat is 17 (15 permanent, 1 driver and 1 sweeper). It is estimated that usually on a regular working day of the week around 47 people are usually present in the premises which includes staffs, peoples representatives, visitors, etc.

Daily drinking water consumption = 1.6 x 47 = 75 L

( Per capita per day drinking water is 1.6 lpcd)

Flush water use in toilets by staff =2.5 x 5 x 17 x 90/100 = 191 L

( The average daily flush in toilets by staff  is 2.5 &amp; capacity of the urinal cistern is 5 L ) (assuming 90 percent of staff present daily)

Flush water use in toilets by visitors  = 0.5 x 5 x 30 = 75 L

( The average daily flush in toilets by visitors  is taken as 0.5 )

Total flush water use in toilets = 266 L

Total time tap is opened on average day for hand washing by staff is 2 x 1.5 x 17 x 90/100 x 50/100 =  22.95 minutes

( average daily frequency of hand washing per staff is 2 and average time the tap is opened while hand washing is 1.5 minutes ) (assuming 50 percent of staff using tap daily)

Water use in basins for face/hand washing by staff = 22.95 x 5 = 115 L

( the average flow rate in the basins is around 5 litres per minute )

Total time tap is opened on average day for hand washing by visitors is 15 x 1 x 30/60 = 7.5 minutes

( average daily frequency of hand washing per visitor is 1 and average time the tap is opened while hand washing is 20 seconds )

Water use in basins for face/hand washing by visitors = 5 x 7.5 = 37.5 L

Total water use in basins for face/hand washing = 152.5 L

Total water use in floor mopping is approx 50 L/day

Therefore based on the above recordings, monitoring and calculation the total water consumption is 543.5 L per day.

No of Taps = 06

No of Toilets = 06

= 2200 Litres

= 2200 Litres/day

Average no of Toilet uses per day

= 50

= 50 X 10

= 500 Litres/day

Average no of urinal uses per day

= 50

= 200 X 3

= 600 Litres/day

Total for Toilet complex

- = 1100 Litres/day

Therefore based on the above recordings, monitoring and calculation the total water consumption is 1690 L per day

|   SL No | Activity             |   Water use in L/day |   Percentage of total use |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
|       1 | Drinking             |                   80 |                      4.73 |

## Water Losses

- Water Losses  = System Input -Authorized Use

- = 2200-1690

- = 510 Litres

- = 23.1 % of System Input

- = 30.2 % of Authorised Use

## 8. Conclusions and Recommendations

## Conclusions

- None of the public buildings analyzed in the study have category wise water meters to understand category-wise  usage. Water meters are  available  only  for  the  main  water supply line from KWA. Public buildings that have wells as main water source, water is pumped randomly as when required. For some buildings, the KWA water meter is not working/installed or is concealed.
- Water supply lines are very old for some of the buildings and line leakages would be present;
- The water leakages were not identified one by one and marked as part of the study;
- Since no category/section wise water meters are installed for these public buildings the authorised water usages were calculated based on the general criteria case to case and through surveys;
- The total  system input water  was  calculated  based on  the  surveys  carried  out  during December 2018 and April 2019.
- Major component of water usage in these public buildings is for toilet/urinal flushing;
- On an average 20-30 % of the system input water is wasted by various means;

## Recommendations

Strategies for reducing water consumption in general

- Install data-logging water meters.

Installing  data-logging  water  meters  on  incoming  water  enables  ongoing  monitoring.

This  helps  to  identify  trends,  usage  patterns  and leaks.  The  data  loggers  are  usually  sourced  from your water retailer.

- Check for leaks

A significant amount of infrastructure is ageing and prone to leaks. As much of it is underground, leaks are not always easily identified. Data-logging meters at the boundary are useful because out-ofhours data (when water use is expected to be very low) becomes readily available.

- Install sub-metering

Metering  of  separate  buildings  and  key  processes  enables  usage  and  trends  to  be monitored  throughout  the  site.  The  use  of  meters  that  are  connected  to  a  building management system (BMS) enables easy data collection.

- Install flow restrictors

A  number  of  fixtures  (for  example,  hand  basins,  sinks  and  wash  troughs)  have unregulated  water  flows  that  may  lead  to  higher  use.  Installing  flow  restrictors  with

balanced  pressure  is  generally  a  cost-effective  way  to  reduce  water  use  without affecting functional requirements.

## · Install dual-flush toilets

Replace old toilet with a low flush toilet (6 litres per flush), a high efficiency model (4.8 litres per flush), or a dual model (3 or 6 litres per flush). Older toilet models can use 13 to 26 litres of water per flush.

Replacing  an  old  toilet  with  an  ultra-low  volume ULV)  1.6  gallon  flush  model  represents  a  70% savings in  water  and  will  cut  indoor  water  use  by about  30%.  Alternatively,  consider  purchasing  a dual flush toilet or installing a dual flush converter that  turns  a  standard  toilet  into  a  dual flush toilet, saving an average family 15,000 gallons  of  water  each  year.  More  water  can  be used when it's needed.

- Reclaim or recycle water
- If possible replace old toilet with a dry toilet, which does not use any water for flushing
- Replumb old toilet to use rainwater for flushing
- Collecting rainwater will meet the demand for gardening purpose for times of low rainfall
- Install  water tap aerators or more efficient fixtures. Aerators for hand/utensils washing can reduce the water consumption by 80-90% as per manufacturers
